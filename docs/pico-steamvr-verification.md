# Neo3 SteamVR verification

These records distinguish source and VM checks from bounded native Pico tests.
Private calibration, binary artifacts and hash manifests remain in gitignored
`output/`. See [driver setup](pico-steamvr.md) for the opt-in configuration.


Host ASan/UBSan and native ARM64 tests verify 52,272 UV comparisons across four
panel rotations, identity and chromatic models, projection signs, eye transforms,
profile refusal and the private optical profile's structural validity. Earlier
pose tests verify the recorded vendor-to-OpenVR chain and invalidation.

A 2026-10-21 native Pico run independently receives 8,148 live tracked poses from
10,821 vendor callbacks. It consumes 249 synchronized head-camera sets, reports
no publication failure, and invalidates the mapping at shutdown. The independent
OpenVR-structure observer sees a maximum sampled capture age of 5.306 ms. Both
camera groups stop, the IMU producer joins and MCU references return to zero.
This observer is separate from SteamVR's server; it does not prove compositor
integration or physical optical alignment.

An offline oracle also reproduces b1977 `libSlamTools.getPredictResult` at zero
prediction for 1,024 synthetic poses. The fitted complete rigid transform matches
position within `7e-17` vendor units and quaternion components exactly. The native
stationary gravity sample supports its upward world axis. This establishes the
firmware SDK conversion, not physical metric accuracy, the active room origin
or completed head/lens acceptance. Private coefficients and evidence remain
under `output/pico-live-steamvr-20261021-v1/`.

A subsequent 30-second native capture publishes 28,627 tracked poses from 31,250
vendor callbacks and consumes 749 synchronized head-camera sets. Valve's actual
ARM64 `vrserver` loads `reframed_pico`; the physical client receives 300 tracked
HMD samples with no invalid samples. Capture and SLAM stop cleanly afterward.
This establishes live server integration using the firmware-derived SDK head
transform; it does not establish physical motion accuracy or presentation.

The compositor finds the panel and selects 90 Hz, but its first swapchain fails
with `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`. The same direct GPU probe fails as the SteamVR user
and presents 64 frames using both DMA planes as root. A libdrm check confirms
the vendor kernel denies unprivileged `DROP_MASTER` and `SET_MASTER`, even while
the file already holds master. The held-master WSI patch addresses that redundant
reacquisition. The rebuilt library then passes the same test as the unprivileged
SteamVR user: 64 GPU-rendered frames, 63 framebuffer changes, matching pixel
readbacks, both DMA planes active and successful present waits. The old source
fails the ownership regression; the patched source passes its held-master,
reacquisition, denial, nested-reference and external-file cases under sanitizers.
The reproducible build and device evidence are under
`output/mesa/pico-held-master-20261021-v2/` and the live-session evidence directory.
This closes the isolated swapchain permission failure; SteamVR's complete render
and synchronization paths require separate acceptance.

The next comparison isolates a second initialization failure: creating the same
swapchain succeeds at 120 Hz and fails at 90 Hz with
`VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` on this kernel/display path. The optical profile
already specifies 120 Hz; SteamVR's bundled `preferredRefreshRate` defaults to
90 Hz independently. Setting that preference to 120 Hz makes the actual Valve
compositor select 120 Hz and create its two-image FIFO direct-display swapchain.
The session template preserves that verified setting. This does not establish
90 Hz support or clean optical presentation.

The compositor subsequently fails during renderer resource creation at
`vulkanrenderer.cpp:2710`, after constructing both distortion meshes. A Mesa
logging build identifies `VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE` at
`vk_semaphore.c:165`. Disassembly of this exact native compositor confirms
creation of a timeline semaphore with OPAQUE_FD export. The running 4.19 kernel
supports the binary sharing tests but does not expose DRM timeline sync objects;
Mesa reports no external timeline support. The guarded launcher therefore does
not start the Steam overlay. This identifies the failed resource and missing
capability; it does not establish that enabling the capability will close all
remaining renderer failures. See the [targeted kernel backport](pico-drm-timeline-backport.md).
Evidence is retained under `output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v2/`, including
the hash-verified `error-log-export.tar.gz` and `renderer-resource-analysis.json`.
All camera/IMU/SLAM and SteamVR processes then stop, MCU references return to
zero and both DSPs go offline. Full BOOT/DTBO readbacks match the backups, and
the device returns to stock b1977 with Wi-Fi off and the updater disabled.

With the matching timeline kernel, the compositor passes that resource creation
and then terminates in Frame's optional perception library on its platform-name
check. The compositor-only namespace isolation above removes this fatal error:
the log records the unavailable CVP motion estimator and continues through
`Startup Complete`. The actual SteamVR client again receives 300 valid HMD
samples and no invalid samples. The native vendor process publishes 90,064
tracked poses, consumes 2,249 synchronized head-camera sets and stops cleanly,
with MCU references returning to zero.

A read-only, DMA-buffer-synchronized capture finds both DMA planes using the
same linear 1920×3664 framebuffer. Its stored pixels contain two optically
distorted views of SteamVR's skybox. This establishes compositor rendering into
the physical scanout buffer; it does not establish clean lens output, a coherent
single-frame capture, sustained presentation rate or measured head alignment.
The original Frame perception library retains SHA-256
`44ca80763343d6588798bb52418611304fd50e2fd7de6ddfce5cbd31989e1984`.
The hash-verified evidence is in
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v3/export-isolated.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `9933b940527ab3e446639ef09e6eec12f9b1fa8872eae8156ce158ad039053fa`).

The next Steam launch passes its initial missing data-link failure after creating
the required owned `~/.steam/steam` and `~/.steam/root` links to the client, with
`sdkarm64` selecting its native libraries. It then triggers a `vrserver` SIGSEGV
shortly after Steam connects. The service journal, exact mapped libraries and
core dumps identify the libnm constructor failure described above; the kernel
log does not report a GPU fault. With the retained-library launcher, the next
90-second capture publishes 90,061 tracked poses and consumes 2,249 head-camera
sets. The actual client reports 300 valid poses and no invalid samples. Steam,
its native web helper, the server and compositor remain running through the
display test. All 280 plane queries succeed and observe 96 framebuffer changes
across two buffers. This is evidence of continuing scanout, not a frame-rate
measurement. The capture still shows the skybox, so Steam overlay visibility
remains unverified. The manifest-checked archive is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v3/export-steam-render.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `9cbc2474dc14fee7bed02a18f5280c95475cd4e8d2f52e7a334e18320e1703d9`).
Realtime-priority requests also remain denied, despite
raising the unit's resource limits; timing requires separate investigation.

The physical probe's optional `--dashboard` mode requests the dashboard, then
reports actual dashboard visibility, the two known overlay texture dimensions,
chaperone calibration state and headset activity. It returns 9 if head tracking
passes but the dashboard remains hidden. The ordinary pose-only mode is unchanged;
both modes still require the explicit physical boot serial and `reframed_pico`.
An optional argument after `--dashboard` selects a dashboard overlay by key,
for example `--dashboard reframed.pico.steam`. Omitting that argument preserves
the runtime's default dashboard selection. The request does not change tracking
origins, calibration or headset activity. When a key is supplied, success also
requires that specific overlay to exist, be visible and be the active dashboard.
Dashboard mode also logs sampled `GetFrameTiming` values and before/after
`GetCumulativeStats` records with a monotonic native timestamp. The latter counters
belong to the last scene application; `app_pid=0` does not measure dashboard FPS.
These read-only diagnostics do not change the probe's visibility acceptance.

The next hardware comparison receives another 300 valid head samples but returns
9: Steam's `valve.steam.gamepadui.main` texture exists at 1920×1080 and the named
gamescope overlay at 1280×800; both are hidden. Thus process startup and allocated
UI textures do not establish visible Steam UI. Adding the original Frame
`vrmonitor` identifies a separate loader failure: its bundled Qt 5.7 lacks
`QPushButton::hitButton(QPoint const&)`. The probe reports calibration state 201
(tracking center uninitialized) and activity 0 (idle). Neither observation alone
establishes why the dashboard is hidden. No floor, play area or physical
calibration was fabricated.
Evidence is retained in
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v3/export-monitor.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `bb7cd890a3906b15292747df135793b92442f78100059a7fb3490a5d5adc502b`).

The cached Frame Qt 5.15.16 bundle subsequently passes `ldd -r vrmonitor` on the
Pico, and the monitor stays running until the test's cleanup. All 15 staged Qt,
plugin and dependency files match their source manifest. This uses a private Qt
directory first in the monitor's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, with its matching XCB plugin;
the preserved SteamVR runtime is unchanged. The transfer carrier is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v3/frame-qt.tar.xz`
(SHA-256 `07d23aac0f39aad9f547e3d3e69d83bdaf32a8268e99ab15bb4b6feca60f51c9`).

That session ends because the compositor receives SIGXCPU, not because the
monitor exits. The compositor core records `SI_KERNEL`; its saved process limits
show unlimited ordinary CPU time and a 200,000 microsecond hard realtime limit.
The interrupted render thread is inside the KGSL submission ioctl. The saved soft
limit is 1,100,000 microseconds, consistent with the kernel increment after a
realtime timeout. SDL's [Linux realtime scheduling implementation](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/src/core/linux/SDL_threadprio.c)
sets a 200 ms hard limit and half that soft limit before asking RealtimeKit.
That source corroborates the limit values; it does not establish which scheduling
call succeeded in this binary or why this GPU submission exceeded the budget.
The hash-verified compositor-core archive is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-compositor-core.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `1c4077508fd63eee9fb7f755143a9524caa2ce1dbd06eaa70975e36e90986618`).

A bounded diagnostic sets `SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_POLICY=other`, `LimitRTPRIO=0`,
`LimitNICE=-20` and `RestrictRealtime=yes` only for the compositor. It keeps the
kernel realtime throttling unchanged and does not grant scheduler capabilities. SDL documents
the ordinary-policy hint in its [pthread implementation](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/src/thread/pthread/SDL_systhread.c).
The compositor survives the comparison; all sampled compositor threads use
ordinary or batch scheduling. The dashboard probe receives 1,000 valid poses and
no invalid poses but returns 9, with both Steam overlays still hidden. All 280
plane queries succeed and observe 141 framebuffer changes. A scanout capture
still shows only the skybox. This separates the timeout from the unresolved UI
visibility issue; it is not a production timing fix or a frame-rate benchmark.
The manifest-checked archive is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-other.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `85087e637b4cbe3fe7ad93f66e593a329bb52eaf3848f85630b0a4131a063f78`).

The next session explicitly starts the preserved runtime's ARM64 `vrdashboard`
and requests `ShowDashboard("reframed.pico.steam")`. The probe reports the
dashboard and gamescope overlay visible, with 500 valid poses and no invalid
poses. Both DMA planes use the same 1920×3664 framebuffer; a synchronized readback
contains Steam's controller-setup screen in both optically distorted eye views.
The compositor and Steam remain active through the test. Calibration still
reports 201, so no fabricated room calibration was needed to reach this result.
This establishes rendered Steam UI in the physical scanout with live head poses;
it does not establish clean lens output, physical motion accuracy, input usability
or sustained VR performance. The manual component sequence must include the
dashboard process; Frame's packaged service instead enters through `vrstartup`.
The manifest-checked archive is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-dashboard-service.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `c19c12642cc45514dd1ff8383f9af8862632fe6e47d5e16cc0bcc6118bf22fc1`).

A same-generation control repeats both default and named requests before starting
`vrdashboard`: both return 9, with 300 valid poses each and the overlays hidden.
After starting `vrdashboard`, the same named request passes with 500 valid poses;
the requested overlay is now both active and visible. Readbacks before and after
show the skybox and Steam's setup screen respectively. This verifies the missing
dashboard process as a visibility blocker in the manual component sequence.
The 90-second capture publishes 90,062 tracked poses, consumes all 2,249 head-frame
sets and stops cleanly with zero MCU references. BOOT and the retained working
DTBO still match their complete backup hashes. The manifest-checked control is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-dashboard-control.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `2bfe8d80519ec110e456e412e47505c3deb8884031cb6b6f04e8faa7252a681b`).

The timing baseline keeps the selected Steam overlay visible and returns 2,000
valid poses without invalid samples. All 20 sampled OpenVR frame-timing records
are available. Their frame indices advance at approximately 59.87 per second,
while 120 DRM vblank queries measure 119.9999 Hz. Reported compositor GPU time
ranges from 10.50 to 10.73 ms (median 10.56 ms), CPU submission from 0.45 to 0.70 ms
and present spin-wait from 0.004 to 0.011 ms. Application cumulative counters
remain zero with `app_pid=0`, as expected without a scene application. The GPU
samples exceed the 8.33 ms budget for 120 Hz; they do not isolate a shader,
clock, idle-policy or scheduling cause, and include contention allowed by the
OpenVR timing contract. Ordinary compositor scheduling remains diagnostic.
The manifest-checked baseline is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-dashboard-timing.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `3da157bc16fba79204ef4cd1afba0baa7cbd35102ad0f764bdd650be170be1d5`).

Selecting the cached client's `-vrdisable` option instead of `-vr` runs its normal
Big Picture frontend inside the same gamescope OpenVR dashboard. Valve's
compositor and live tracking remain in use. This removes the separate
`valve.steam.gamepadui.main` overlay; the gamescope overlay remains active and
visible. The captured frontend is still at its input-setup screen. This run
records 1,998 valid poses and two invalid poses; those invalid samples remain an
acceptance concern. All 12 live GPU-frequency samples remain at 305 MHz under
the existing `msm-adreno-tz` governor, whose supported maximum is 587 MHz.
The manifest-checked comparison is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-bpm.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `0c15595586f6e3e041df379549fb04915534b247680075c7d65f23aed6abddfd`).

A bounded comparison requests the advertised 587 MHz operating point through
`devfreq/min_freq`, after arming an independent 150-second restoration timer.
The vendor devfreq and KGSL source retain maximum-frequency and thermal clamping;
neither control is disabled. All 12 live samples confirm 587 MHz. Median reported
compositor GPU time falls to 6.55 ms (range 6.49–6.89 ms), and the dashboard check
receives 2,000 valid poses without invalid samples. GPU sensors stay below
49.5 °C in the sampled interval. Frame indices nevertheless advance at only
about 64.82 per second, so this does not resolve presentation pacing. Cleanup
restores the original 305 MHz minimum, independently read back afterward; BOOT
and DTBO still match their full backup hashes. No persistent clock policy is
installed. The manifest-checked comparison is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-gpu-opp.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `9e242cc736b9600b1aee0b5157555ec20b5a9af2aa04ee036be7c75a8f08cade`).

The setup screen is the cached Steam client's generic SteamOS input page,
identified by its `https://s.team/os` link and the matching bundled UI source.
That source supports automatic advancement when a keyboard or controller is
detected. Delivering Return to the focused `Steam Big Picture Mode` X11 window
does not establish setup completion. A temporary standard uinput keyboard is
correctly classified by udev (`ID_INPUT_KEYBOARD=1`), but Steam still reports zero
keyboards and the captured input page remains. The device is destroyed at test
cleanup. The same run receives 2,000 valid poses without invalid samples; queries
for `framesToThrottle`, `powersaveFramesToThrottle` and
`additionalFramesToPredict` return error 5 (unset with no default), so their
returned zeros cannot establish the active throttling policy. Evidence is in
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-native-keyboard.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `ba5c632217f723855a9511e84f0da302c6bcbca3db58ee9d2449fe190a2feaa2`).

A source-matched Continue click through the client's loopback CEF debugger
advances its DOM to `Welcome / Select a language`, but the subsequent physical
scanout still contains the preceding input page. This is control-plane progress,
not accepted presentation of the new page. The manifest-checked evidence is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-steam-cef-v2.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `703888e3d37201834e905844ddfdff703d4f14ee8c673ca0c7ccb95fdacefe9b`).

The diagnostic root reports Fedora 44, so forcing the client's `-steamos` mode
does not establish a working Frame OS installation. A disposable unprivileged
process successfully enters and leaves FIFO/RR policies at priorities 1 and 80
with the specified limits. A combined launch comparison then removes `-steamos`,
enables gamescope's installed `-e` Steam integration, allows priority 80 and sets
a 2/2.5-second realtime limit, while retaining the SDL ordinary-policy hint and
the bounded 587 MHz request. This profile fails: the compositor's saved live
limits have nevertheless been reduced to 100/200 ms, all sampled thread policies
remain ordinary/batch, and the service journal reports SIGXCPU after 23 seconds.
The camera helper later exits on SIGSEGV. Those observations do not establish a
single cause for both failures. This profile is rejected; its realtime limits
and launch changes are not adopted as a verified replacement configuration.
The manifest-checked archive is
`output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/export-native-profile.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `0546ecc20dfe11b210152ae8687a480302b60f7285f2d8e836722ff228c940f3`).

The GPU minimum is restored to 305 MHz, complete BOOT/DTBO hashes still match,
MCU references return to zero and both DSPs go offline before reboot. The Pico
returns to b1977 with Wi-Fi off, the updater disabled and `flash.locked=0`, recorded
in `output/pico-steamvr-session-20261021-v4/stock-return-final.json`.

Clean lens output, measured motion scale/direction, sustained compositor timing
and usable Steam UI remain hardware acceptance steps. The default configuration
remains disabled until explicitly supplied.
